  Both players can stomp the same shutter handle.
  <br />
  5 Pieces (2 buttons, dial, north, south)

  <p><strong>Softlock warning</strong><br />Don't use the A button (usually mapped to jump) after getting on the Shipping Floor cart - this will cause the cart to spawn far out in the Telegraph section</p>

  <p>If this happens, it's not actually a true softlock. If you can parachute over to the keyboard and shut down the machine, you can then jump off the level again.<br />
    The kiwi spawn positions are set on the cart so once they parachute back onto the cart it should end the level.<br />
    If the level doesn't end after the kiwis have landed, put in a very small amount of movement so that your feet touch the cart - you might be standing on Zoey's head or on top of one another.</p>
